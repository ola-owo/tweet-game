Everything else is pure fiction and forgery.
I was in fact at the Hotel Villa Magna on April 22nd giving an interview to Manu Sainz something the reporter himself is able to corroborate
Deeply outraged by a situation intended, in vain, to afect my personal life, I just want to clarify...
...someone seeking the limelight on my account.
And I wonder why this happens one day before a very important game for my team…
I was informed that The Sun, faithful to its editorial line, will publish an article where is given voice to a so called Andressa...
